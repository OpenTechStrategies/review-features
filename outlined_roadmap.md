 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_roadmap
 
A technology roadmap is a plan that matches short-term and long-term goals with specific technology solutions to help meet those goals.[1] It is a plan that applies to a new product or process, or to an emerging technology.[2]

Developing a roadmap has three major uses.[3] It helps reach a consensus about a set of needs and the technologies required to satisfy those needs, it provides a mechanism to help forecast technology developments, and it provides a framework to help plan and coordinate technology developments.

|-
! rowspan=2 | Satisfy essential conditions
| Identify essential conditions
| When all the '''participants''' come together, essential '''conditions''' can be identified (e.g. what groups should be involved, what are the key customers and what are the key suppliers).
|-
| Take action to satisfy conditions
| For technology roadmapping to succeed, '''conditions''' from the '''participants''' must be satisfied.
|-
! Provide leadership / sponsorship
| &nbsp;
| The part of '''leadership''' / '''sponsorship''' should be taken by line organization; they must drive the roadmapping process and use the roadmap to make resource allocation decisions.
|-
! rowspan=4 | Define the scope and boundaries for the technology roadmap
| Clearly state vision
| The already existing '''vision''' has to be clear.
|-
| Develop vision
| The '''vision''' is developed and stated clearly.
|-
| Define scope
| The '''scope''' of the project can further define the set of '''needs''', '''planning horizon''' and level of '''detail'''. The scope can be further divided into the '''technology scope''' and the '''participation scope'''.
|-
| Define boundaries
| The '''boundaries''' should also be included.
